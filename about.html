<h1>About</h1>
<p>
<a href="https://www.danielnewberry.xyz">..</a>
<br><br>
I am a PhD Candidate and Researcher at <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk">Newcastle University Business School</a>, currently focusing on sustainability, entrepreneurship, the environment and SMEs in the UK.
<br><br>
<h2>Background</h2>
<br>
<p>
I started the PhD in 2021, after previously completing an MA Arts, Business and Creativity and a BA (Hons) Music degree, both from Newcastle University. 
<br><br>
Whilst I was studying for my undergraduate degree, I set up my first business - a record label based in Newcastle that releases music both digitally and on cassette tape. Following this I then expanded to start a creative media consultancy offering marketing and communications support for SMEs in the North East of England.
<br><br>
Whilst running both of these businesses, I started my postgraduate MA course to better understand the nexus between the arts, the creative industries and 'the world of business'. Through my dissertation research, I developed a real interest in how environmental sustainability affects the small business sector. I then had the opportunity to develop this into further research through a PhD in Business and Management at Newcastle University Business School, which is where I am now. 
</p>
<br>
<h2>Research</h2>
<br>
<p>
I am currently looking into the sustainable entrepreneurs within the North East of England to build a sustainability/owner/business nexus.
<br><br>
The specific research question I am looking to answer is:
<br><br>
<mark>How do the contexts of the business, owner-manager and sustainability interact for the sustainable entrepreneur?</mark>
<br><br>
This research aims to extend previous research around small businesses, sustainable business development and the identity of business owner by further considering the interaction and interplay between different contexts surrounding the business owner/founder, their sustainable business, and environmental sustainability.
