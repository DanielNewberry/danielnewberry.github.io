    Hello.
    <br><br>
    This is my <s>1st</s> <s>2nd</s> <s>3rd</s> <s>4th</s> <s>5th</s> 6th attempt at a personal website. I've had websites before, but they didn't do what I wanted them to do. (Mainly because I didn't take the time to learn <i>how</i> to get them to do what I wanted them to do). 
    <br><br>
    Previously, I've used all-in-one website builders and hosting such as <a href="https://www.squarespace.com">Squarespace</a> and <a href="https://www.weebly.com/websites">Weebly</a>, the <a href="https://www.canva.com/website-builder/">Canva Websites</a> builder that comes with the Canva Pro membership and website builder frameworks such as <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> (built on the <a href="https://go.dev">Go Language</a>).
    <br><br>
    Whilst they all had their merits, there were too many issues for me to deal with. 
    <br><br>
    Squarespace looked amazing and had a lot of dynamic responsiveness built in. But it was expensive and there were so many barriers to posting content such as navigating menus and waiting for elements to load in. I realised it was great for dynamic, static websites (an oxymoron I know, but basically a website that looked great and was interactive but where the content didn't need to be updated regularly).
    <br><br>
    Weebly was a nightmare. Poor mobile optimisation and the drag-and-drop was limited and resulted in dated looking websites.
    <br><br>
    Canva Websites was good for ease of setting it up, however it would be expensive if I wasn't already paying for the Canva Pro membership for what you got. Again, mobile optimisation was poor too. And there were no blogging or posting features so anything outside of a one-page website was impossible without creating multiple files and linking across.
    <br><br>
    The Hugo framework was good, but there were a lot of learning curves. Also, I realised that when compiling the website to update, it was just updating and creating new HTML and CSS files. 
    <br><br>
    Hugo got me the closest to what I wanted, especially when running the <a href="https://github.com/Masellum/hugo-theme-nostyleplease">no-style-please!</a> theme - which looks almost identical to how this site looks now. 
    <br><br>
    So, I just took the modified HTML and CSS files and decided to build them myself directly. I know a fair bit about HTML and CSS (thanks high school ICT class) and I'm just editing them using <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a> and pushing changes to a <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> repository. This lets me use my custom .xyz domain and as long as the repository is kept as open source, hosts the website for free too. 
    <br><br>
    What I like about this website is the design. I remember growing up with the change from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 and seeing so many personally designed websites get swapped out for social media platforms. 
    <br><br>
    Call me old fashioned but I like the more basic looking websites. You know how to find what you're looking for. And you own everything. I'm not relying on an external company 
    <br><br>
    Take the <a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com">Berkshire Hathaway</a> website for exmaple. They are worth US$705.34bn (on 14-04-2023). And their website is just static HTML. But for their primary audience - their shareholders - they can access any and all of the information they need straight away. Some may say it is old and boring. I say it is perfect for serving it's purpose. 
    <br><br>
    So what is the purpose of this website? Well, I just wanted a place to store all of my things. This website is like that drawer you have at home with the half-used notebooks and the random cables you can't throw out because you might remember what they are for and need them. 
    <br><br>
    The home page has links to me socials and a link to information about me. 
    <br><br>
    Underneath there are blog entries. 
    <br><br>
    At this point I don't know what else I need. And if I think of something, with this system I've got now, I'm confident I can implement it easily.
